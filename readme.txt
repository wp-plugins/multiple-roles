Allow users to have multiple roles on one site.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to select multiple roles for a user - something that WordPress already supports "under the hood", but doesn't provide a user interface for.

User edit and Add new user screens will display a checklist of roles instead of the default role dropdown. The main user list screen will also display all roles a user has.

It also supports well Multisite mode.

That's it. No extra settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who can edit users roles? =

Anyone with the `edit_users` capability. By default, that means only administrators and network administrators on multi-site.

= Can you edit your own roles? =

If you're a network administrator on a multi-site setup, yes, you can edit your roles in sites of that network. Otherwise, no. This is how WordPress works normally too.

= I'm on the user edit screen - where's the checklist of roles? =

It's underneath the default profile stuff, under the heading "Permissions". If you still can't find it, you might be on your own profile page, or you might not have the `edit_users` capability.

= Can you remove all roles from a user? =

Sure. The user will still be able to log in and out, but won't be able to access any admin screens or see private pages. However, the user will still be able to see the WP Toolbar by default, which displays links to the Dashboard and Profile screens, so clicking on those will result in seeing a permission error.
